## WHOOP App Development
[Skip to main content](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/getting-started/#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

# Getting Started

To start developing with WHOOP, you first need to create an `App` in
the WHOOP [Developer Dashboard](https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/). If you're already registered in the Developer Dashboard,
you can skip this section and learn [how to authenticate with WHOOP](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth) using your app's `Client ID`
and `Client Secret`.

The [Developer Dashboard](https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/) site manages Client Secrets and access to WHOOP OAuth API endpoints. The log-in for the Developer Dashboard uses the same credentials as your WHOOP account.

## Creating your first App [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/getting-started/\#creating-your-first-app "Direct link to Creating your first App")

To create your first App, head to the [App creation flow](https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/apps/create) in the Developer Dashboard. You will be prompted to [create a Team](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/getting-started#creating-your-team) if you have not yet done so.

You can create up to 5 Apps. If you need more, please submit a request for more apps via [this link](https://whoopinc.typeform.com/to/XmzituEp).

### Scopes [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/getting-started/\#scopes "Direct link to Scopes")

Scopes define the limits of access your App will have to an individual's account data. At least one scope _must_
be specified to create an App. When performing the OAuth flow, you can request one or more of these scopes from a WHOOP member.

![Scopes](https://developer.whoop.com/assets/images/whoop_developer_portal_scopes-ee15e8f3de9421931a924c038c18d041.png)

Please note that you should limit the scopes requested to _only_ the ones your application will use.

You can learn more about the available scopes and what they represent
from the [API Docs](https://developer.whoop.com/api#section/Authentication).

### Redirect URIs [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/getting-started/\#redirect-uris "Direct link to Redirect URIs")

You must specify at least one redirect URL for each App. The redirect URI on your OAuth authorization request must match the
value in the Developer Dashboard. You may provide multiple Redirect URIs that your client needs.

![Redirect URIs](https://developer.whoop.com/assets/images/whoop_developer_portal_redirect_uris-0d036f504d93ab3ec293252e4b056151.png)

### Completing Client Creation [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/getting-started/\#completing-client-creation "Direct link to Completing Client Creation")

After filling in all the fields, click the **Create** button at the bottom to complete the process.

## Accessing Client Credentials [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/getting-started/\#accessing-client-credentials "Direct link to Accessing Client Credentials")

After you have created your App, you will be provided with your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. These values are required to complete the OAuth flow.

Note: your `Client Secret` should _never_ be logged or shared with anyone. It should only be used server side and should never be exposed in a client, web, or mobile application.

After creating the App, you will be able to see these values later by clicking into
the app from the [Apps](https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/) section, where all your current Apps are listed.

## Editing or Deleting an App [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/getting-started/\#editing-or-deleting-an-app "Direct link to Editing or Deleting an App")

To change any details about your app, navigate to the [App](https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/), click the pencil icon, edit any values, and save your app.

![App Actions](https://developer.whoop.com/assets/images/whoop_developer_portal_app_actions-846303cb5b5558cc3c8492c7fa3b8581.png)

Caution!

Clicking the red trash can button will delete the app. Exercise caution when deleting apps, as this action cannot be undone.

* * *

## Creating your team [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/getting-started/\#creating-your-team "Direct link to Creating your team")

Before creating your first app, you'll be prompted to create a Team.

![Team](https://developer.whoop.com/assets/images/whoop_developer_portal_create_team_prompt-9510aeb091d250f404a6b38a0f2e463a.png)

After clicking **Get Started**, you'll be taken to the team creation form.

![Team Creation](https://developer.whoop.com/assets/images/whoop_developer_portal_create_team-8c6947a4e8d60bb8db4076b146f62798.png)

Choose a name for your team and click **Create Team**.

## Adding Users To A Team [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/getting-started/\#adding-users-to-a-team "Direct link to Adding Users To A Team")

You can add other developers to your team to share access to app information and management.

To invite someone to your team, you can head to the [Team](https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/team) section of the Developer Dashboard and click the **Invite** button in the top right corner.

![Team Invite](https://developer.whoop.com/assets/images/whoop_developer_portal_team_invite_button-c34e9c10ec5a3873c22a689468826b4e.png)

From there, you can add another developer to your team. To add the developer to your team, you need the email address associated with their WHOOP account.

![Invite by email to team](https://developer.whoop.com/assets/images/whoop_developer_portal_invite_to_team_filled-5be47dac1ecb2049ce17fb01c34799a1.png)

## WHOOP OAuth 2.0 Guide
[Skip to main content](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

# OAuth 2.0

All endpoints for retrieving a WHOOP user's data require successful authorization via
the [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) protocol.
[IETF RFC-6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) documents the full standard. While we will not explain OAuth 2.0
generally in this section, we will demonstrate how to use it to authorize an app's access to a WHOOP user's data after
the user grants consent.

Any subsequent references to _OAuth_ in this documentation will be
referring to _OAuth 2.0_.

We recommend you use a library to manage the details of the OAuth flow. You can find recommended libraries in a variety
of programming languages
[here](https://oauth.net/code/).

## Pre-requisite [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#pre-requisite "Direct link to Pre-requisite")

Before starting, you must create an App in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard. You can follow
the [getting started](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/getting-started) to learn how if you have not already.

## Required Information for OAuth [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#required-information-for-oauth "Direct link to Required Information for OAuth")

### Client ID [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#client-id "Direct link to Client ID")

The `Client ID` can be found after creating a client in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard.

### Client Secret [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#client-secret "Direct link to Client Secret")

You can find the `Client Secret` after creating a Client in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard.

### Authorization URL [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#authorization-url "Direct link to Authorization URL")

This WHOOP URL prompts a user to authorize your app to access the WHOOP user's data. After
the user grants authorization, WHOOP will respond with an authorization code.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
https://api.prod.whoop.com/oauth/oauth2/auth

```

### Token URL [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#token-url "Direct link to Token URL")

This WHOOP URL provides your app with the authorization code from
the [authorization URL](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/#authorization-url) after the WHOOP user authorizes your app to access their WHOOP data. This
endpoint provides an access token in exchange for the authorization code.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
https://api.prod.whoop.com/oauth/oauth2/token

```

### Redirect URL [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#redirect-url "Direct link to Redirect URL")

WHOOP will redirect the user to the [Redirect URL](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/redirect-uris/) after they
authorize your App to access the request scopes. You must register the Redirect URL in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard.

A valid URL will take the form of `https://whoop.com/example/redirect` or `whoop://example/redirect`.

**Note:** Your OAuth library may reference `Redirect URL` as a `Callback URL`.

### State [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#state "Direct link to State")

The [state parameter](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/state-parameters) is a security measure to prevent
against [CSRF attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf). It's a generated random string
that you provide to WHOOP's server. Upon successful authorization by the user, WHOOP will respond with this same state
value.

Your OAuth 2.0 library may handle this functionality for you; however, you may be responsible for explicitly using it by
setting the option to true.

The state parameter must be eight characters long if you need to generate it yourself.

### Scope [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#scope "Direct link to Scope")

The [scope parameter](https://oauth.net/2/scope/) is how your application declares which data and what level of access
is being requested.

When the OAuth flow prompts a WHOOP user to authorize access to your app, the user will see the list of scopes your
app requested. The user must authorize access to them before WHOOP grants your app a token.

You can learn more about what scopes are available in [the API Docs](https://developer.whoop.com/api#section/Authentication).

## Request An Access Token [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#request-an-access-token "Direct link to Request An Access Token")

We highly recommend using a library to manage the flow. There are available libraries in
many [programming languages](https://oauth.net/code/).

The steps that the library will follow are:

1. Your application will send a request to the Authorization URL for an
[authorization code](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/).
2. WHOOP prompts the user to log in with their WHOOP credentials.
3. The user will confirm they authorize access to your app.
4. WHOOP will respond to the Redirect URL with an authorization code.
5. Your application will send a request to the Token URL, exchanging the
authorization code for an access token (and optionally a refresh token if your app requested the `offline` scope).

### Access Token Request Examples [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#access-token-request-examples "Direct link to Access Token Request Examples")

- [Javascript and Passport](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-passport)

## Using An Access Token [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#using-an-access-token "Direct link to Using An Access Token")

After receiving an access token, all requests must include the access token. Your app should pass the access token as
a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header.

WHOOP will return the requested data if the access token is successfully verified. However, if the token is invalid,
WHOOP returns a `401 - Unauthorized` response.

## Access Token Expiration [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#access-token-expiration "Direct link to Access Token Expiration")

Access tokens are only valid for a short time. WHOOP provides the token expiry in the `expires_in` parameter (in
seconds). After the token expires, your app must
[refresh the token](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/#refreshing-an-access-token).

### Refreshing an Access Token [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#refreshing-an-access-token "Direct link to Refreshing an Access Token")

Access tokens are short-lived, depending on
the `expires_in` value. WHOOP will respond with a (401 -
Unauthorized) [HTTP status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/401) if your app sends a
request with an expired access token.

When the access token is expired, you can no longer use it and must refresh the token. If you do not want to wait
for the token to expire before refreshing, you can refresh the complete set of access tokens regularly. One
strategy is to execute refreshing access tokens using a background cron job.

Existing access tokens are invalidated once your app uses the refresh token to generate a new access token. The access
token from the refresh response is now the valid access token, and your app can use the new access token for future
requests.
Similarly, the refresh token from the refresh response is now the valid refresh token, and your app must use the new
refresh token on the subsequent refresh request.

Another advantage to refreshing tokens in a recurring job is that it limits the likelihood of issues occurring with
multiple
concurrent requests attempting to refresh an expired token. When your app makes simultaneous refresh token requests, the
first refresh request that reaches WHOOP will succeed. The second request would fail because the first request
invalidates the refresh
token.

### Receiving a Refresh Token [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#receiving-a-refresh-token "Direct link to Receiving a Refresh Token")

WHOOP provides your app with a refresh token after completing the OAuth 2.0 flow _if_ the `offline` scope is
included in the authorization request. You _must_ request the `offline` scope to receive a refresh token.

### Required Information To Refresh [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#required-information-to-refresh "Direct link to Required Information To Refresh")

#### Refresh Token Endpoint [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#refresh-token-endpoint "Direct link to Refresh Token Endpoint")

The WHOOP URL where your app sends a POST request including the refresh token in exchange for a new access token.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
https://api.prod.whoop.com/oauth/oauth2/token

```

#### Refresh Token [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#refresh-token "Direct link to Refresh Token")

If your app requests the `offline` scope during the OAuth authorization flow, WHOOP returns a refresh token that your
app uses to refresh expired access tokens.

#### Client ID [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#client-id-1 "Direct link to Client ID")

The Client ID is a unique identifier for your Client app. Your app uses this ID to authenticate with WHOOP.
You can create and manage this ID in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard.

#### Client Secret [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#client-secret-1 "Direct link to Client Secret")

The Client Secret is a secret value that accompanies a Client ID. You can view the Client Secret in
the WHOOP Developer Dashboard.

### Sample POST Request Payload [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#sample-post-request-payload "Direct link to Sample POST Request Payload")

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
{
  "grant_type": "refresh_token",
  "refresh_token": "{{RefreshToken}}",
  "client_id": "{{ClientID}}",
  "client_secret": "{{ClientSecret}}",
  "scope": "offline"
}

```

The payload above uses [Postman variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/), rather than
actual data. The variables represent:

- RefreshToken - the value of the refresh token you receive along with
an access token.
- ClientID - the client identifier created in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard.
- ClientSecret - the secret that accompanies the Client ID in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard.

### Sample POST Response Payload [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#sample-post-response-payload "Direct link to Sample POST Response Payload")

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
{
  "access_token": "the-value-of-the-new-access-token",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "the-value-of-the-new-refresh-token",
  "scope": "offline other-scopes-requested",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}

```

## Revoking an Access Token [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/\#revoking-an-access-token "Direct link to Revoking an Access Token")

When a user disables your integration, you should revoke their access token from your application to respect their privacy. If you have adopted [webhooks](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks), revoking an access token will ensure that you no longer receive webhooks for this user.

To revoke an access token, you can use the [revokeUserOauthAccess](https://developer.whoop.com/api/#tag/User/operation/revokeUserOAuthAccess) API endpoint.

## WHOOP Developer Overview
[Skip to main content](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/overview/#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

# Overview

Before diving into specifics, let's review the process for launching an app on the WHOOP Developer Platform.

## 1\. Sign up for WHOOP [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/overview/\#1-sign-up-for-whoop "Direct link to 1. Sign up for WHOOP")

You must have a WHOOP membership to develop an app on the Developer Platform. Your WHOOP account is also your WHOOP
developer login. You can join WHOOP [here](https://join.whoop.com/?utm_source=whoop&utm_medium=developer).

## 2\. Create an App in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/overview/\#2-create-an-app-in-the-whoop-developer-dashboard "Direct link to 2. Create an App in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard")

The [WHOOP Developer Dashboard](https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/) is where you register your app with WHOOP. You
can create a new app, access your Client Secret, and invite other developers to view and maintain the
app. [Getting started with the Developer Dashboard](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/getting-started) will walk you through registering
your first app.

You can create up to 5 apps. If you need more, please submit a request for more apps via [this link](https://whoopinc.typeform.com/to/XmzituEp).

## 3\. Authenticate with WHOOP using the OAuth 2.0 protocol [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/overview/\#3-authenticate-with-whoop-using-the-oauth-20-protocol "Direct link to 3. Authenticate with WHOOP using the OAuth 2.0 protocol")

Once you have a `Client ID` and `Client Secret` in the Developer Dashboard, you can use
the [OAuth standard](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth) to request consent from WHOOP members to access data on their
behalf. Once a WHOOP member grants your app permission, you will receive a per-user Access and Refresh Token that your
app uses on requests to the WHOOP API.

## 4\. Make requests to the WHOOP API [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/overview/\#4-make-requests-to-the-whoop-api "Direct link to 4. Make requests to the WHOOP API")

WHOOP exposes RESTful endpoints that you can access using the Access and Refresh Token from **Step #3: Authenticate with**
**WHOOP**. You can view the documentation on the API endpoints [here](https://developer.whoop.com/api).

## 5\. Launch your app [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/overview/\#5-launch-your-app "Direct link to 5. Launch your app")

## Pagination in API
[Skip to main content](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/pagination/#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

# Pagination

Collections such as the [Cycle](https://developer.whoop.com/api#operation/getCycleCollection)
, [Recovery](https://developer.whoop.com/api#operation/getRecoveryCollection), [Sleep](https://developer.whoop.com/api#operation/getSleepCollection),
and [Workout](https://developer.whoop.com/api#operation/getWorkoutCollection)
Collections can include a large number of records. Responses to queries on the collection may be truncated, but you can
paginate through the results to read the full collection.

The Collection APIs return a token to represent the current page on each response. You send that token on the subsequent
request to retrieve the next page. You iterated through all pages if the `next_token` field is empty on the response.

Using the' limit' header, you can also control how many records the API endpoint returns per page. However, the API
endpoint will not return more than the max allowed value ( [API Docs](https://developer.whoop.com/api#operation/getCycleCollection) specify the
max value on each endpoint).

## Example [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/pagination/\#example "Direct link to Example")

Let's query a user's sleep for the first three months of 2022. We make the first request specifying the query parameters
for `start` and `end`.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
GET https://api.prod.whoop.com/developer/v1/activity/sleep?start=2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z&end=2022-04-01T00:00:00.000Z

```

The request returns each sleep in the `records` field and a `next_token`, which we can use on the request to get the
next
page.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
{
  "records": [\
    {\
      ...\
    }\
  ],
  "next_token": "eyIkIjoib0AxIiwibyI6MTB9"
}

```

The `next_token` can be placed on the subsequent request to fetch the next page of Sleeps using the same query parameters.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
GET https://api.prod.whoop.com/developer/v1/activity/sleep?nextToken=eyIkIjoib0AxIiwibyI6MTB9&start=2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z&end=2022-04-01T00:00:00.000Z

```

You can continue paginating in this manner to retrieve all pages until the `next_token` is empty.

## WHOOP API Rate Limiting
[Skip to main content](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/rate-limiting/#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

# API Rate Limiting

All clients are subject to two sets of rate limiting for requests. By default,
clients may only send:

- 100 requests per minute.
- 10,000 requests per day.

Rate Limit Increases

Upon request, WHOOP can increase your rate limits. Please submit a request for increased rate limits via [this link](https://whoopinc.typeform.com/to/XmzituEp) and be sure to include details surrounding your request.

## Rate Limit Information [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/rate-limiting/\#rate-limit-information "Direct link to Rate Limit Information")

Information about current rate limits is provided in response headers, following this
[specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/id/draft-polli-ratelimit-headers-05.html#name-header-specifications).

You may see response headers that look like the following:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
X-RateLimit-Limit = "100, 100;window=60, 10000;window=86400"
X-RateLimit-Remaining = "98"
X-RateLimit-Reset = "3"

```

### X-RateLimit-Limit [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/rate-limiting/\#x-ratelimit-limit "Direct link to X-RateLimit-Limit")

This value expresses the current values for the rate-limiting and over what
[time window](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/id/draft-polli-ratelimit-headers-05.html#name-time-window).

The example here is using the default rate limits. The client has not reached any limit yet and is

closest to hitting the `minute` window (versus the `day` window). The first number ( `100`) states the
limit the client is closest to hitting. The time window is in seconds. `100;window=60` describes the first
rate limit of 100 requests per minute (60 seconds). `10000;window=86400` represents a rate limit of 10,000 requests over
a 24-hour (86,400 seconds) period.

### X-RateLimit-Remaining [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/rate-limiting/\#x-ratelimit-remaining "Direct link to X-RateLimit-Remaining")

`X-RateLimit-Remaining` is the number of requests that your app may execute within
the [time window](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/id/draft-polli-ratelimit-headers-05.html#name-time-window)
before WHOOP will reject subsequent requests. In this case, the client is closest to hitting the minute
limit of 100, so `X-RateLimit-Remaining: 98` means the client can make 98 more requests in that minute. In other words,
the client only made two requests in the current minute.

### X-RateLimit-Reset [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/rate-limiting/\#x-ratelimit-reset "Direct link to X-RateLimit-Reset")

`X-RateLimit-Reset` is the number of seconds that need to elapse before the `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header resets. In
this case, the client is closest to hitting the minute limit of 100 so
the `X-RateLimit-Reset` header corresponds to that limit precisely.

## Rate Limited Response [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/rate-limiting/\#rate-limited-response "Direct link to Rate Limited Response")

After an API key's rate limit has been reached or exceeded, WHOOP's servers will respond with
a `429 - Too Many Requests` HTTP status code.

# Support

## FAQ [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/support/\#faq "Direct link to FAQ")

#### How do I get started with the WHOOP Developer Platform? [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/support/\#how-do-i-get-started-with-the-whoop-developer-platform "Direct link to How do I get started with the WHOOP Developer Platform?")

To get started, you need to sign up for an account on whoop.com and obtain a WHOOP device. Once you have an account, you can create an application by navigating to Dashboard on developer.whoop.com and logging in with your account credentials. You can reference our [getting started](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/getting-started) guide to learn how to integrate WHOOP data into your application.

#### What data is available through the WHOOP API? [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/support/\#what-data-is-available-through-the-whoop-api "Direct link to What data is available through the WHOOP API?")

The WHOOP API provides access to various types of data, including [activity](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/user-data/workout) data, [sleep](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/user-data/sleep) data, [recovery](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/user-data/recovery) data, and more. For a detailed list of available endpoints and the data they return, please refer to our [API documentation](https://developer.whoop.com/api).

#### Are there any costs associated with using the WHOOP API? [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/support/\#are-there-any-costs-associated-with-using-the-whoop-api "Direct link to Are there any costs associated with using the WHOOP API?")

Access to the WHOOP Developer Platform and API is currently free. However, you must have a WHOOP device, which requires a membership. Check [join.whoop.com](https://www.join.whoop.com/?utm_source=whoop&utm_medium=developer) for more details.

#### Do you offer a sandbox environment for developers who do not have a WHOOP? [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/support/\#do-you-offer-a-sandbox-environment-for-developers-who-do-not-have-a-whoop "Direct link to Do you offer a sandbox environment for developers who do not have a WHOOP?")

We require all developers on the Developer Platform to have a WHOOP device. Using WHOOP and understanding the user flow dramatically helps with understanding and integrating with our API.

#### What are the future improvement plans for the WHOOP API? [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/support/\#what-are-the-future-improvement-plans-for-the-whoop-api "Direct link to What are the future improvement plans for the WHOOP API?")

We strive to continuously improve our API offering and make it straightforward to work with. We will regularly update the API as new functionality and features are released, and note the update in our [changelog](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/api-changelog/). For ideas on enhancing the API, please [share](https://whoopinc.typeform.com/to/XmzituEp) them with us.

#### What is your rate limiting policy? [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/support/\#what-is-your-rate-limiting-policy "Direct link to What is your rate limiting policy?")

Check out our rate limiting policy [here](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/rate-limiting).

#### What is a rough estimate of how much a dayâ€™s worth of data for an individual would be in terms of KB? [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/support/\#what-is-a-rough-estimate-of-how-much-a-days-worth-of-data-for-an-individual-would-be-in-terms-of-kb "Direct link to What is a rough estimate of how much a dayâ€™s worth of data for an individual would be in terms of KB?")

A dayâ€™s worth of member data (with one workout, one sleep, and one recovery) would be about 4 KB. For each additional workout or nap, add 1 KB.

#### How often should we refresh tokens in the OAuth flow? [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/support/\#how-often-should-we-refresh-tokens-in-the-oauth-flow "Direct link to How often should we refresh tokens in the OAuth flow?")

You should refresh tokens every hour. See an example flow [here](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/server-side-apps/example-flow/) and documentation for refreshing an access token [here](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/making-authenticated-requests/refreshing-an-access-token/).

#### Do I, as the developer, need to show that my app has collected a memberâ€™s authorization in my UI? [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/support/\#do-i-as-the-developer-need-to-show-that-my-app-has-collected-a-members-authorization-in-my-ui "Direct link to Do I, as the developer, need to show that my app has collected a memberâ€™s authorization in my UI?")

The WHOOP member should always be able to see that they've granted you access to their data. You should offer an easy and intuitive way for the member to [disable](https://developer.whoop.com/api/#tag/User/operation/revokeUserOAuthAccess) the integration as well. The member can also revoke access to an integration via the WHOOP app.

#### Generally, what is the lift to use the API? [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/support/\#generally-what-is-the-lift-to-use-the-api "Direct link to Generally, what is the lift to use the API?")

The WHOOP API utilizes [OAuth 2.0](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth) authentication, which is well-documented and industry standard, and [webhooks](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/) to notify when new data is available. Integrating with the WHOOP API is very straightforward. Typically, the hardest part of integrating with the WHOOP API is understanding the data model ( _e.g., what is a [physiological cycle](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/user-data/cycle), and how does that differ from a calendar day?_). Weâ€™ve heard from countless developers that wearing a WHOOP makes understanding the API and data model significantly easier.

#### Does the API offer access to continuous heart rate data? [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/support/\#does-the-api-offer-access-to-continuous-heart-rate-data "Direct link to Does the API offer access to continuous heart rate data?")

Each WHOOP device can broadcast heart rate over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to other devices. Many applications have implemented a Bluetooth listener to let members connect their WHOOP as a heart rate monitor. Continuous heart rate data is not available via the WHOOP API.

## Submitting feedback [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/support/\#submitting-feedback "Direct link to Submitting feedback")

## WHOOP Cycle Data Model
[Skip to main content](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/user-data/cycle/#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

# Cycle

The human body undergoes a biological rhythm of asleep, awake, asleep, awake. We often think of one repetition within a
calendar day, such as Tuesday, April 19, 2022. However, calendar days and sleep patterns don't always align. Some people work when
other people are sleeping. Some people don't go to sleep for at least 24 hours.

We always reference a member's activity in the context of a Physiological Cycle (known as Cycle for short)
rather than calendar days. When you request a member's latest Cycle, the member's current Cycle will only have a `Start Time`.
Cycles in the past have both a start and end time.

## WHOOP Recovery Overview
[Skip to main content](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/user-data/recovery/#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

# Recovery

WHOOP Recovery is a daily measure of how prepared your body is to perform. When you wake up in the morning, WHOOP
calculates a Recovery score as a percentage between 0 - 100%. The higher the score, the more primed your body is to take
on Strain that day.

In addition to the WHOOP Recovery score, the Recovery object has objective measurements that factored into the
score such as the resting heart rate (RHR), heart rate variability (HRV), and for 4.0 members, blood oxygen (SpO2)
and skin temperature.

## WHOOP Sleep Tracking
[Skip to main content](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/user-data/sleep/#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

# Sleep

WHOOP tracks a member's [sleep performance](https://support.whoop.com/s/article/WHOOP-Sleep). You
can view details and measurements about sleep.

**Note:** In addition to the sleep activity that starts a [Cycle](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/user-data/cycle), a member can also take _naps_
throughout the Cycle. WHOOP sets the field `nap` to true on a Sleep that is a Nap. Naps reduce the amount of sleep needed by a member for the next Cycle.

## WHOOP Webhooks Guide
[Skip to main content](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

# Webhooks

WHOOP webhooks allow you to get notified when an event takes place for users that have authenticated with your app. By subscribing to webhooks, you will be alerted when a user's data was updated rather than needing to constantly make API requests to check for updates.

## Setting Up Webhooks [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/\#setting-up-webhooks "Direct link to Setting Up Webhooks")

You will first need to create an HTTPS URL endpoint to receive webhooks. This endpoint should be capable of accepting POST requests with a body consisting of the [webhook data format](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/#webhook-specifications) and be able to perform [webhook signature validation](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/#webhooks-security).

With your webhook endpoint set up, you can [create or update](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/getting-started) an app to start accepting webhooks at that URL. Simply add your HTTPS URL to the **Webhook URL** section at the bottom of the page and save the app.

That's it! The next time a WHOOP user that has authenticated with your app triggers one of the supported webhook events, you will receive a webhook alerting you of the change.

## Webhook Specifications [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/\#webhook-specifications "Direct link to Webhook Specifications")

Webhooks are sent over HTTPS as a POST request to your configured URL. The body of the webhook request includes the following fields:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| user\_id | int64<br>The WHOOP User for the event |
| id | int64<br>Identifier of the object that triggered this webhook |
| type | string<br>Enum:"workout.updated""workout.deleted""sleep.updated""sleep.deleted""recovery.updated""recovery.deleted"<br>The type of event that triggered this webhook |
| trace\_id | string<br>Trace ID for the event that triggered this webhook |

Copy

`{
"user_id": 10129,
"id": 10235,
"type": "workout.updated",
"trace_id": "d3709ee7-104e-4f70-a928-2932964b017b"}`

### Webhook Event Types [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/\#webhook-event-types "Direct link to Webhook Event Types")

There are several events that are published as webhooks:

| Event Type | ID Type | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `recovery.updated` | The id of the cycle for the recovery | Occurs when a recovery is created or updated. |
| `recovery.deleted` | The id of the cycle for the recovery | Occurs when a recovery is deleted. Note: a recovery is deleted when its associated sleep is deleted. |
| `workout.updated` | The id of the workout | Occurs when a workout is created or updated. |
| `workout.deleted` | The id of the workout | Occurs when a workout is deleted. |
| `sleep.updated` | The id of the sleep | Occurs when a sleep is created or updated. |
| `sleep.deleted` | The id of the sleep | Occurs when a sleep is deleted. |

note

All webhook event types will be sent to the Webhook URL configured against your app. As such, if you do not want to process a certain type of event, you can simply respond with a `2XX` and skip any other processing you would normally do.

## Webhooks Security [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/\#webhooks-security "Direct link to Webhooks Security")

In order to validate that the webhooks you are receiving are originating from WHOOP, you will want to implement signature validation. This can be done by making use of two of the headers sent with each webhook request:

- `X-WHOOP-Signature` \- the actual signature
- `X-WHOOP-Signature-Timestamp` \- the milliseconds since epoch timestamp used to verify the signature

To verify the signature, first prepend the timestamp header value to the raw http request body. Then, generate a SHA256 HMAC signature of that string using the secret key for your app, which can be found in the [WHOOP Developer Dashboard](https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/). Finally, base64 encode the result, and compare it to the signature header. If they do not match then the request is invalid and should be dropped.

See below for example signature validation pseudocode:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
calculated_signature_string = base64Encode(HMACSHA256(timestamp_header + raw_http_request_body, client_secret))

```

## Example Request Flow [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/\#example-request-flow "Direct link to Example Request Flow")

To illustrate a webhook use case, check out the below example request flow that utilizes webhooks.

1. WHOOP user `456` goes through the OAuth consent flow with your app, allowing you to read their sleep data.
2. WHOOP user `456` records a sleep. WHOOP assigns id `1234` to this sleep.
3. WHOOP makes a post request to your webhook endpoint with the body of:




```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
{
     "user_id": 456,
     "id": 1234,
     "type": "sleep.updated",
     "trace_id": "e369c784-5100-49e8-8098-75d35c47b31b"
}

```

4. Based on seeing `sleep.updated` in the `type` field, your app makes a GET request to the `/activity/sleep/1234` endpoint using the access token for WHOOP user `456` in order to retrieve the sleep data.

As you begin implementing webhooks, you should have logic for interpreting each of these webhook event types. As shown in the example above, when you receive a `sleep.updated` webhook for user `456`, you may want to make a request to the `v1/activity/sleep/{sleepId}` endpoint using the sleepId of `1234` and the token for user of `456` if you want to get the data of the sleep the webhook was sent for.

## Webhooks Testing [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/\#webhooks-testing "Direct link to Webhooks Testing")

To generate a webhook, first authenticate with your app to ensure your data is retrievable via the API. Then, open the WHOOP app and do one of the following:

1. [Log an activity](https://support.whoop.com/s/article/Logging-Activities-Sleep) in the past (e.g. navigate to yesterday and create a 5 minute cycling activity)Â â€“ once this activity is processed, your webhook endpoint will receive a `workout.updated` webhook.
2. Edit a previous sleep by changing the start or end time by 1 minuteÂ â€“Â once the sleep is processed, your webhook will receive both a `sleep.updated` webhook and a `recovery.updated` webhook.

You can then edit or delete the workout you created, and you can revert the sleep duration change. Each of these actions will also result in webhooks being sentÂ â€“ `workout.updated`, `workout.deleted`, and `sleep.updated`, respectively.

## Delivery & Retries [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/\#delivery--retries "Direct link to Delivery & Retries")

WHOOP will retry webhook delivery for failed webhook requests **five times over the course of about one hour**. A webhook delivery is considered failed if it receives any response other than a successful `2XX`, or if it receives no response before timing out.

In order to reduce the amount of delivery failures you encounter, you should consider processing the requests asynchronously after returning a successful response, e.g. with a queue worker.

## Best Practices [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/\#best-practices "Direct link to Best Practices")

While working with webhooks, it is important to follow these best practices in order to ensure that you can get the most out of the webhook system.

### Respond quickly [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/\#respond-quickly "Direct link to Respond quickly")

As laid out in the [Delivery & Retries](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/#delivery--retries) section, WHOOP will not indefinitely retry if your webhook endpoint is determined to be unavailable. We recommend designing your webhook API to return a successful `2XX` status code within a second and for high availability. If your webhook implementation has other dependencies or needs to do expensive work, one strategy is to have your API enqueue the event on a queue for asynchronous processing.

### Validate signatures [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/\#validate-signatures "Direct link to Validate signatures")

Be sure to validate the message signature to ensure webhooks you receive were actually sent by WHOOP. Check out the [Webhooks Security](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/#webhooks-security) section to see more details on how to implement this.

### Implement a reconciliation job [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/\#implement-a-reconciliation-job "Direct link to Implement a reconciliation job")

Since webhook delivery can fail webhooks should not be the sole source of truth for your application. Therefore, we recommend implementing a reconciliation job to occasionally fetch data from WHOOP.

## Limitations [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/\#limitations "Direct link to Limitations")

There are a few limitations to be aware of when implementing webhooks:

- It is possible you will receive multiple webhook invocations for the same triggering event. You can make use of the `trace_id` field in the webhook to detect duplicate webhooks.
- These are event based webhooks, meaning they are notifications of changes and not actually the changes themselves. You will need to call the API in order to retrieve the most up-to-date data around this event. There is an example of what this flow would look like in the [Example Request Flow](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/#example-request-flow) section.
- It is possible that a webhook may be missed. You should implement a reconciliation job that can occasionally reach out to the WHOOP API for the data types you care about to fetch data that may have been missed.

## Webhooks FAQs [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/\#webhooks-faqs "Direct link to Webhooks FAQs")

#### Why are there only update and delete events? Do we get notified of create events? [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/\#why-are-there-only-update-and-delete-events-do-we-get-notified-of-create-events "Direct link to Why are there only update and delete events? Do we get notified of create events?")

Yes! When workouts, sleeps, or recoveries are created those events are
published as an "update" event.

#### Are there webhooks for Day Strain, cycles, or body measurements? [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/\#are-there-webhooks-for-day-strain-cycles-or-body-measurements "Direct link to Are there webhooks for Day Strain, cycles, or body measurements?")

Not at the moment; these data points should be retrieved by calling their
respective APIs. All of the current webhook types are listed in the [Event Types](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/#webhook-event-types) section.

#### How can I stop receiving webhooks for users who have disabled my integration? [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/webhooks/\#how-can-i-stop-receiving-webhooks-for-users-who-have-disabled-my-integration "Direct link to How can I stop receiving webhooks for users who have disabled my integration?")

It is best practice to [revoke access tokens](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#revoking-an-access-token) for users who have disabled your integration. Once you do revoke their access token, no webhooks will be sent for the user.

On this page

# Authenticating with WHOOP (with Passport)

Though Javascript is a primary language for client-side application development, all requests to WHOOP must be made
server-side. This tutorial does not propose or require a given framework for building Javascript
server-side applications. Some examples of Javascript server-side frameworks are [express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
and [next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

You can choose from one of the many OAuth 2.0 libraries. In this tutorial, we will
use [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/)
for authentication. Specifically, this will use
the [passport-oauth2](http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-oauth2/) package.

## Install Dependencies [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-passport/\#install-dependencies "Direct link to Install Dependencies")

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
npm install passport passport-oauth2

```

Additionally, if you're using Typescript, you'll want to include the type
definitions as well:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
npm install @types/passport @types/passport-oauth2

```

## Configure The Strategy [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-passport/\#configure-the-strategy "Direct link to Configure The Strategy")

We first need to define the data `Passport` will need to complete the OAuth 2.0
authorization flow, stored in a configuration.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
const whoopOAuthConfig = {
    authorizationURL: `${process.env.WHOOP_API_HOSTNAME}/oauth/oauth2/auth`,
    tokenURL: `${process.env.WHOOP_API_HOSTNAME}/oauth/oauth2/token`,
    clientID: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET,
    callbackURL: process.env.CALLBACK_URL,
    state: true,
    scope: [\
        'offline',\
        'read:profile'\
    ],
}

```

The data elements are:

- `authorizationURL`: The WHOOP URL prompts a user to sign in to WHOOP and
authorize your application. [Learn more](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#authorization-url)
- `tokenURL`: The WHOOP URL to exchange an authorization code for an access
token. [Learn more](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#token-url)
- `clientID`: A unique identifier for your client. [Learn more](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#client-id)
- `clientSecret`: A secret value that accompanies your client
identifier. [Learn more](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#client-secret)
- `callbackURL`: WHOOP will redirect the user to this location after the user authorizes your
application. [Learn more](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#redirect-url)
- `state`: Set this to `true` to have the strategy define the state value
that WHOOP will pass back to your app. [Learn more](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#state)
- `scope`: A list of the data types and operations your app can access. We are requesting the `offline` scope to
retrieve a refresh token and `read:profile` to access User
Profile information from the WHOOP API in this example. You need to add the relevant scopes your app needs
access. [Learn more](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#scope)

## Determine What To Do After Authentication Succeeds [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-passport/\#determine-what-to-do-after-authentication-succeeds "Direct link to Determine What To Do After Authentication Succeeds")

`Passport` needs a function to execute once the OAuth flow is complete. What occurs in that function is specific to your
application.

In this example, we will use the received information from the OAuth flow to save the user to our database
using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/). But, of course, what your application does with this may differ.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
const getUser = async (
    accessToken,
    refreshToken,
    {expires_in},
    profile,
    done,
) => {
    const {first_name, last_name, user_id} = profile

    const createUserParams = {
        accessToken,
        expiresAt: Date.now() + expires_in * 1000,
        firstName: first_name,
        lastName: last_name,
        refreshToken,
        userId: user_id,
    }

    const user = await prisma.user.upsert({
        where: {userId: user_id},
        create: createUserParams,
        update: createUserParams,
    })

    done(null, user)
}

```

Passport will pass in several parameters that we can use in our application-specific logic:

- `accessToken`: the access token to retrieve user information from the WHOOP
API. For future requests, your app must pass the Access Token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header. We will
use this as an example below to retrieve [profile\\
data](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-passport/#get-user-profile-information).
- `refreshToken`: Your app can use the Refresh Token to retrieve a new access token after expiration. [Learn\\
more](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#refresh-the-token)
- `results`: this is an object that contains fields for `access_token`,
` expires_in`, `scope`, and `token_type`.
- `profile`: the normalized representation of a user's profile data. The Passport library will populate the `profile`
because we later tell Passport how to [get user profile\\
information](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-passport/#get-user-profile-information).
- `done`: a callback function accepting errors and the user as the parameters.

Given all that information, we are extracting the user's first name, last name,
and WHOOP user id from their profile and storing that in our database, along
with their active tokens.

Note that Passport's documentation shows a function that takes [four\\
parameters](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-oauth2#configure-strategy).
Using this won't have the information about when the token expires, so we're
instead, we're relying on
a [less-common variant](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-google-oauth/issues/23#issuecomment-27128329)
for this data.

## Get User Profile Information [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-passport/\#get-user-profile-information "Direct link to Get User Profile Information")

WHOOP includes an API endpoint to access user profile details, which your app
will have access to if the app requests (and the user authorizes) the
`read:profile` scope.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
const fetchProfile = async (
    accessToken,
    done,
) => {
    const profileResponse = await fetch(
        `${process.env.WHOOP_API_HOSTNAME}/developer/v1/user/profile/basic`,
        {
            headers: {
                Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
            },
        },
    )

    const profile = await profileResponse.json()

    done(null, profile)
}

```

This [async function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)
uses Javascript's [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
to make a request to the WHOOP profile endpoint, passing in the access token we
receive from a successful OAuth 2.0 flow as a bearer token in the Authorization header.

The function returns the user's profile information. Passport [normalizes](http://www.passportjs.org/docs/profile/)
received profile information.

## Use The WHOOP Strategy [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-passport/\#use-the-whoop-strategy "Direct link to Use The WHOOP Strategy")

Now that we have all of the individual pieces built, it's time to put them
together.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
const whoopAuthorizationStrategy = new OAuth2Strategy(whoopOAuthConfig, getUser)
whoopAuthorizationStrategy.userProfile = fetchProfile

passport.use('withWhoop', whoopAuthorizationStrategy)

```

Here we are building a strategy, passing it our WHOOP configuration and telling it what to do when a user is
authenticated - which is to save or get the user from our database.

We're also telling the strategy to use our ability to fetch profile information.

Lastly, we're telling Passport itself to use our newly-created strategy.

## Authenticate With WHOOP [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-passport/\#authenticate-with-whoop "Direct link to Authenticate With WHOOP")

We need to authenticate requests using `passport.authenticate()`. Where this gets invoked will depend on your framework
of choice. Let's assume an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) application.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
app.get('/auth/example',
    passport.authenticate('withWhoop'));

app.get('/auth/example/callback',
    passport.authenticate('withWhoop', {failureRedirect: '/login'}),
    function (req, res) {
        res.redirect('/welcome');
    });

```

How this gets invoked in your middleware stack or routing layer will depend on
the framework you're using.

## Congratulations [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-passport/\#congratulations "Direct link to Congratulations")

After going through this tutorial, you have learned:

- How to build a custom Passport OAuth 2.0 strategy to complete the OAuth flow with WHOOP.
- Where to add your custom logic to handle user management and persistence.
- How to access a user's profile information and tell Passport about it to automatically retrieve user information from
WHOOP.
- How to connect those individual pieces with Passports OAuth 2.0 package.

The next step for you is to plug this into whatever framework or middleware you're using to trigger Passport

## WHOOP API Authentication
[Skip to main content](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-postman/#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

# Authenticating with WHOOP

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is an application you can use to make,
save, and share API requests. It includes the functionality to complete an
OAuth 2.0 flow for user data. Being programming language-agnostic, it may be a
great starting point to validate your [credentials](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#client-id) are functioning.

## Environment Setup [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-postman/\#environment-setup "Direct link to Environment Setup")

The Postman collection used here requires that you set up the Client Secret information from
the WHOOP [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/getting-started), and you saved the data as Postman variables.

![Create Environment Variables](https://developer.whoop.com/assets/images/01.postman_environment_setup-55a1da03cafe1003070bdc343ab67c98.png)

In the Postman app, navigate to the "Environments" section on the far left.
Then, add or modify two [variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) in the main content
window:

1. `ClientId` \- this is the unique client Id from the WHOOP [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#client-id).
2. `ClientSecret` \- this is the secret for the client Id from
the WHOOP [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#client-secret).

In addition to naming these variables, fill in the values with the credentials
from the Developer Dashboard.

**Note**: _The screenshot does not show that information to avoid_
_sharing credentials._

Now you're ready to use those values as variables for the rest of the flow, and
don't need to share the actual secrets in the saved requests.

## Starting the Authorization Flow [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-postman/\#starting-the-authorization-flow "Direct link to Starting the Authorization Flow")

Postman includes support for completing the OAuth
2.0 [flow](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/authorization/#oauth-20).
This section will show you how to give Postman access to your WHOOP
credentials for future requests.

Navigate to the "Collections" section on the far left, and select the collection
name for the WHOOP API in the pane to the right of that.

Next, select the "Authorization" heading in the main content window. It should
be underlined in orange.

![Postman Authorization](https://developer.whoop.com/assets/images/02.postman_authorization-ff4c2a10a4f033583cd4eb56ee4978f6.png)

Fill in the fields as follows:

- **Type**: OAuth 2.0
- **Add auth data to**: Request Headers
- **Access Token**: Available tokens
- **Header Prefix**: Bearer
- **Grant Type**: Authorization Code
- **Callback URL**: check "Authorize using browser"
- **Auth URL**: `https://api.prod.whoop.com/oauth/oauth2/auth` \- [Learn more](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#authorization-url).
- **Access Token URL**: `https://api.prod.whoop.com/oauth/oauth2/token` \- [Learn more](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#token-url).
- **Client Id**: `{{ClientId}}` \- this is using the [variable](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-postman/#environments-setup) updated
earlier. [Learn more](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#client-id).
- **Client Secret**: `{{ClientSecret}}` \- this is using the [variable](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-postman/#environments-setup) updated
earlier. [Learn more](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#client-secret).
- **Scope**: A space-delimited list of scopes to request data access to. [Learn more](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#scope).
- **State**: A string that must be at least eight characters long to be sent to the WHOOP server and used for
verification. [Learn more](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#state).
- **Client Authentication**: Send client credentials in body

Lastly, click the "Get New Access Token" button, and Postman will make the
request to WHOOP's Auth URL specified above.

## Sign in to WHOOP [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-postman/\#sign-in-to-whoop "Direct link to Sign in to WHOOP")

Postman should then redirect to a browser window and present WHOOP's sign-in form.

![WHOOP Sign In](https://developer.whoop.com/assets/images/03.whoop_sign_in-d66a9e3a823c0a87d715a00d8914ce4a.png)

Fill in this information with the account information that Postman will use in
future requests to access data.

Click the "SIGN IN" button after providing the account information.

## Authorize Access to WHOOP Data [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-postman/\#authorize-access-to-whoop-data "Direct link to Authorize Access to WHOOP Data")

After providing valid WHOOP user account credentials, Postman will redirect you to a WHOOP log-in asking you to
authorize your app and displays the requested scopes as part of the
OAuth flow. These are all the [scopes](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#scope) that were requested in
Postman [earlier](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-postman/#starting-the-authorization-flow).

![WHOOP Data Authorization](https://developer.whoop.com/assets/images/04.whoop_authorize-611d235767ec38f1a8b935c9c17f8db1.png)

To complete the flow, you must grant the application access by clicking the
"AUTHORIZE" button.

Depending on your browser, you may receive an alert to redirect you back to the
Postman app. Please do so to complete the round-trip.

## Manage Access Tokens [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-postman/\#manage-access-tokens "Direct link to Manage Access Tokens")

After completing the redirect, Postman will next show a modal that displays all
of the token information returned from WHOOP.

![Manage WHOOP Tokens in Postman](https://developer.whoop.com/assets/images/05.postman_token_management-6d00054e0771a49775d3e42f5cbeb8b4.png)

Once again, this screenshot purposely censors the actual _values_ of these
tokens to not share personal information.

If you want to use the `refresh_token` in Postman to request a refreshed
token, you will need to copy this value at this point and save it somewhere
safe. Postman does not retain access to this data.

You will use the Access Token in future requests, and you can
save those credentials in Postman.

## Use Access Token [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-postman/\#use-access-token "Direct link to Use Access Token")

Click the "Use Token" button on the right in the Manage Access Tokens modal.

![Use Token](https://developer.whoop.com/assets/images/06.postman_use_token-6a5e29c2983a565873179f036c3a30c3.png)

For this to persist on future requests, that change must be saved by clicking
the "Save" button on the far right of the collection after leaving the modal.

![Save Collection](https://developer.whoop.com/assets/images/07.postman_save_token_arrow-a7a1d20e2187b853cd29ce48bf836970.png)

## Congratulations [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/access-token-postman/\#congratulations "Direct link to Congratulations")

You have completed the OAuth 2.0 flow using Postman, and you can
make additional requests for WHOOP data using this token in Postman.

## Fetch Current Recovery Score
[Skip to main content](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/get-current-recovery-score/#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

# Get Current Recovery Score

This example will use the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
to make an HTTP request to WHOOP's server.

## Prerequisites [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/get-current-recovery-score/\#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

- Access Token: The token received after completing the OAuth 2.0 flow. Your app must pass the Access Token as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.
- The Access Token is granted permission to `read:cycles` and `read:recovery` OAuth scopes.

## Overview [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/get-current-recovery-score/\#overview "Direct link to Overview")

The process of getting a user's current recovery score requires two steps:

- Get the user's current Cycle. ( [API Docs](https://developer.whoop.com/api#operation/getCycleCollection))
- Get the user's Recovery for the current Cycle if one exists. ( [API Docs](https://developer.whoop.com/api#operation/getRecoveryForCycle))

These two steps are required because every Cycle is not guaranteed to have a Recovery score. For example, the user may not have worn
their WHOOP the previous day. In this scenario, the Recovery score will be missing for the Cycle.

## Get the User's Current Cycle [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/get-current-recovery-score/\#get-the-users-current-cycle "Direct link to Get the User's Current Cycle")

Let's start by getting the current Cycle. The Cycle Collection is sorted by time in descending order, so making a
request with `limit=1` will give us the latest Cycle.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
const accessToken = "__ACCESS_TOKEN_FOR_USER__";

query = new URLSearchParams({
  limit: "1",
});

```

We will append those parameters as query param values to our GET request.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
const getCurrentCycle = async (accessToken, query) => {
  const uri = `https://api.prod.whoop.com/developer/v1/cycle?${query}`;

  const cycleResponse = await fetch(uri, {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    },
  });

  if (cycleResponse.status === 200) {
    return cycleResponse.json();
  } else {
    throw new Error(`Received ${cycleResponse.status} status from Whoop`);
  }
};

```

### Response [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/get-current-recovery-score/\#response "Direct link to Response")

The response will include an array of Cycles, which should have precisely one if the user has at least one Cycle (new users
may not have a Cycle yet, so check there is at least one in the array). You will need the `cycle_id` from the latest cycle
for the next step.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| records | Array of objects (Cycle) \[ items \]<br>The collection of records in this page. |
| next\_token | string<br>A token that can be used on the next request to access the next page of records. If the token is not present, there are no more records in the collection. |

## Get Recovery for Cycle [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/get-current-recovery-score/\#get-recovery-for-cycle "Direct link to Get Recovery for Cycle")

With the latest Cycle, we can now get the Recovery score for the Cycle if one exists. Before using the Recovery score,
there are a few things you should consider:

- Not every Cycle has a Recovery - the user may not have worn their strap the previous day.
- New users may be calibrating. New users require calibration before the Recovery score is relevant to them. The calibration period lasts a few
days for new users. You can use the field `user_calibrating` to check if the user is still in the calibration phase.
- WHOOP may not be able to score every Recovery - you should check if the `score_state` is `SCORED`. If the `score_state` is `PENDING_SCORE`, you will
need to check back later. If the `score_state` is `UNSCORABLE`, a Recovery Score cannot be calculated by WHOOP for this user's Cycle.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
const getRecoveryForCycle: = async (accessToken, cycleId) => {
    const uri = `https://api.prod.whoop.com/developer/v1/cycle/${cycleId}/recovery`

    const recoveryResponse = await fetch(uri, {
        headers: {
            Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
        },
    })

    if (recoveryResponse.status === 200) {
        return recoveryResponse.json()
    } else if (recoveryResponse.status === 404) {
        return null
    } else {
        throw new Error(`Received ${recoveryResponse.status} status from Whoop`)
    }
}

```

### Response [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/get-current-recovery-score/\#response-1 "Direct link to Response")

Upon success, the API should return a 200 HTTP status or 404 if a Recovery does not exist for the current cycle. Remember
not all Cycles will have a Recovery.

## Refresh Access Tokens
[Skip to main content](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/refresh-token-javascript/#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

# Refreshing Access Tokens

This example will use the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
to make an HTTP request to WHOOP's server.

## Prerequisites [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/refresh-token-javascript/\#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

- Refresh Token: A refresh token is received along with an access token when
completing the initial [OAuth 2.0 flow](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#request-an-access-token), when the auth request
includes the
`offline` [scope](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#scope). [Learn\\
more](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#refresh-the-token)
- Client Id: A unique identifier for your client. [Learn more](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#client-id)
- Client Secret: A secret value that accompanies your client
identifier. [Learn more](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#client-secret)
- Refresh Token Endpoint: `https://api.prod.whoop.com/oauth/oauth2/token`
. [Learn more](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth#refresh-token-endpoint)

## Making the Request [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/refresh-token-javascript/\#making-the-request "Direct link to Making the Request")

We first need to assemble the parameters to provide to WHOOP's server in order
to retrieve new access and refresh tokens.

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
const refreshParams = {
    grant_type: 'refresh_token',
    client_id: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET,
    scope: 'offline',
    refresh_token: refresh_token,
}

```

These fields represent:

- **grant\_type**: `refresh_token`. This [grant type](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/refresh-token/)
explicitly tells an OAuth provider you're asking for a refresh token.
- **client\_id**: A unique identifier for your client.
- **client\_secret**: A secret value that accompanies your client identifier.
- **scope**: The `offline` scope allows your app the receive a refresh token, along with
the new access token.
- **refresh\_token**: The value of the refresh token received along with an
access token.

Now that we have the parameters to send to the API endpoint, we can construct
the entire API call:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
const getFreshTokens = async (refreshParams) => {
    const body = new URLSearchParams(refreshParams)
    const headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    }

    const refreshTokenResponse = await fetch(
        `https://api.prod.whoop.com/oauth/oauth2/token`,
        {
            body,
            headers,
            method: 'POST',
        },
    )

    return refreshTokenResponse.json()
}

```

## Response Type [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/refresh-token-javascript/\#response-type "Direct link to Response Type")

The response object received from making the API request will look as follows:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
interface AuthResult {
    access_token: string
    refresh_token: string
    expires_in: number
    scope: string
    token_type: 'bearer'
}

```

## Congratulations [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/refresh-token-javascript/\#congratulations "Direct link to Congratulations")

Your app can now use the new access token for subsequent
API requests for this user's data. Your app can also use the refresh token to complete this flow once the access token
expires.

## Making the Request [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/refresh-token-postman/\#making-the-request "Direct link to Making the Request")

We're going to issue a POST request to the refresh token endpoint to receive a
new access token.

Fill in the fields as follows:

- **HTTP Request Type/Verb**: POST
- **URL**: `https://api.prod.whoop.com/oauth/oauth2/token`

In the Body section, select the "x-www-form-urlencoded" radio button. Fill in
the following keys and values:

- **grant\_type**: `refresh_token`. This [grant type](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/refresh-token/)
explicitly tells an OAuth provider you're asking for a refresh token.
- **refresh\_token**: The value of the refresh token received along with an
access token.
- **client\_id**: A unique identifier for your client.
- **client\_secret**: A secret value that accompanies your client identifier.
- **scope**: The `offline` scope allows you to get a new refresh token and an access token.

In this image, Postman [variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) take the place of the
refresh
token, client id, and client secret. Postman should prepopulate those variables with
the configured values. Alternatively, place the values directly in the
value of the POST data rather than using variables at all.

## Receiving the Response [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/refresh-token-postman/\#receiving-the-response "Direct link to Receiving the Response")

Under the Request Body section, a Response Body should be visible as a JSON
payload. It will have the following form:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
{
  "access_token": "the-value-of-the-new-access-token",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "the-value-of-the-new-refresh-token",
  "scope": "offline other-scopes-requested",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}

```

## Congratulations [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/refresh-token-postman/\#congratulations "Direct link to Congratulations")

You can use the new access token to make additional
API requests for this user's data. You can also use the new refresh token to
complete this flow once the access token expires.

# WHOOP 101

WHOOP is a 24/7 wearable that helps members understand how well their bodies function and how they change over time.
Through continuous monitoring of physiological signals, WHOOP helps members understand how well their body performs
and recovers. As a developer, you have the opportunity to build integrations that leverage WHOOP insights across three
pillars - **Strain, Recovery, and Sleep**.

This guide will provide you with an overview of the core concepts powering WHOOP to get you ready to build your
app.

## Strain [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/whoop-101/\#strain "Direct link to Strain")

WHOOP Strain is a measurement of the amount of stress on your body. The Strain score is a number on a 0 to 21 scale,
based on the [Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion](https://www.whoop.com/thelocker/borg-scale-perceived-exertion-rpe/).
WHOOP scores Strain continuously for members throughout the day and every workout.

**Note:** _Strain is not on a linear scale. It takes more stress to move from a score of **16 to 17**_
_than **4 to 5**._

Your body is constantly changing, and each day is different. If you do the same workout two days in a row, you
will likely report different Strain scores based on fluctuations in how your body recovered and changed. Strain is also
specific to your baseline. Two people making the same motions will likely generate different Strain
scores.

WHOOP categorizes Strain score values into Light, Moderate, High, and All Out.

![Strain scale](https://developer.whoop.com/assets/images/strain_scale-2f4fdf34a654035c2183109fcc053da7.png)

- **Light Strain (0-9)** \- This strain category indicates room for active recovery with minimal stress on the
body.
- **Moderate Strain (10-13)** \- This category indicates moderate stress on the body, which helps maintain
fitness.
- **High Strain (14-17)** \- This category indicates increased stress which helps build fitness gains in
your training.
- **All Out (18-21)** \- This category indicates all-out training or a packed activity day that puts significant stress
on
the body and may be difficult to recover from the day after.

### Workout Activity [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/whoop-101/\#workout-activity "Direct link to Workout Activity")

WHOOP tracks workouts for you and how much Strain accumulated over the workout. You can create workout activities
manually, import them from other sources
like [Apple Health](https://support.whoop.com/s/article/Apple-Health-Integration),
or [WHOOP may automatically detect and classify workouts](https://www.whoop.com/thelocker/activity-auto-detection-knows-you-work-out/)
.

WHOOP keeps track of what type of activity you performed (e.g., Running, Cycle), Strain score, and other
physiological measurements such as duration
in [Heart Rate Zones](https://www.whoop.com/thelocker/max-heart-rate-training-zones/).

A note on Recovery Activities

We recently separated activities that primarily promote Recovery ("Recovery Activities") from those that primarily promote Strain ("Workout Activities"). As such, Recovery activities (examples below) are not accessible via the Workouts endpoint:

- Ice Bath
- Massage Therapy
- Meditation
- Other - Recovery
- Stretching

We will add Recovery activities to the API in the near future.

## Recovery [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/whoop-101/\#recovery "Direct link to Recovery")

WHOOP Recovery is a daily measure of how prepared your body is to perform. When you wake up in the morning, WHOOP
calculates a Recovery score as a percentage between 0 - 100%. The higher the score, the more primed your body is to take
on Strain that day.

WHOOP calculates Recovery scores using measurements from the previous day and your sleep, such as resting heart rate (RHR),
heart
rate variability (HRV), respiratory rate, sleep duration/quality, skin temperature, and blood oxygen. Unlike Strain, a
Recovery score does not change over the day (unless you edit your sleep which triggers a
Recovery score re-calculation).

WHOOP categorizes Recovery scores into one of three colors:
![Recovery Colors](https://developer.whoop.com/assets/images/whoop-recovery-green-yellow-red-92eb184e88896a66470d01a736edbb39.png)

- **GREEN (67-100%)**: You are well recovered and primed to perform. Whether at home, at work, or in the gym, your
body is signaling that it can handle a strenuous day.
- **YELLOW (34-66%)**: Your body is maintaining and ready to take on moderate amounts of strain.
- **RED (0-33%)**: Rest is likely what your body needs. Your body is working hard to recover. Some reasons could include
overtraining,
sickness, stress, lack of sleep, or other lifestyle factors.

## Sleep [â€‹](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/whoop-101/\#sleep "Direct link to Sleep")

WHOOP tracks your sleep, including how long you slept and the stages of your sleep - Light, REM, and Slow Wave Sleep
(Deep). WHOOP also calculates how much sleep you need based on
your [Sleep Debt](https://www.whoop.com/thelocker/what-is-sleep-debt-catch-up/) and your previous day's activity.
