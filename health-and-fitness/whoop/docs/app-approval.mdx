# App Approval Process for WHOOP Developer Platform

**Purpose:** This document guides a Coding AI Agent on the steps required to submit a WHOOP application for approval. Approval is necessary to launch an app to all WHOOP members, as development apps are limited to 10 members.

## 1. Core Concepts & Prerequisites

Before your application can be used by an unlimited number of WHOOP members, it must undergo an approval process. This ensures compliance with WHOOP's terms, design guidelines, and functionality expectations.

*   **Development Limit:** Apps are initially limited to 10 WHOOP members for development and testing purposes.
*   **Approval Requirement:** To exceed the 10-member limit and launch publicly, your app must be approved.
*   **Key Documents:**
    *   [WHOOP API Terms of Use](https://developer.whoop.com/api-terms-of-use/)
    *   [WHOOP Design and Brand Guidelines](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/design-guidelines)
*   **Developer Dashboard:** Used to verify app information.

## 2. Implementation Steps

1.  **Review WHOOP API Terms of Use:** Thoroughly read and ensure your application fully complies with the [WHOOP API Terms of Use](https://developer.whoop.com/api-terms-of-use/). This is a non-negotiable prerequisite.
2.  **Test Your App:** Ensure your application has been thoroughly tested with at least one actual WHOOP member. This validates the integration's functionality and user experience.
3.  **Verify App Information in Developer Dashboard:**
    *   Log in to the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/).
    *   Confirm that your **App Name**, **Contact Email(s)**, and **Privacy Policy URL** are accurately filled in. Inaccurate information can delay the approval process.
4.  **Adhere to Design and Brand Guidelines:** Review and ensure your app's design and branding adhere to the [WHOOP Design and Brand Guidelines](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/design-guidelines). This includes logo usage, typefaces, colors, and overall user experience consistency.
5.  **Submit App Submission Request:** Once all the above steps are completed and your app is ready, fill out the App Submission request form via [this link](https://whoopinc.typeform.com/to/XmzituEp).
    *   Include designs and any other helpful context that can aid the review process.

## 3. Code Example(s)

This feature is primarily a manual process involving compliance, testing, and form submission. There are no direct code examples for the approval process itself. The AI's role here is to ensure the application it develops meets the criteria.

**Example: Checklist for AI (Conceptual)**
```markdown
# App Approval Readiness Checklist for Your WHOOP App

- [ ] Confirmed adherence to WHOOP API Terms of Use.
- [ ] Application has been tested with at least one WHOOP member.
- [ ] App Name, Contact Email(s), and Privacy Policy URL are accurate in Developer Dashboard.
- [ ] Application design and branding comply with WHOOP Design and Brand Guidelines.
- [ ] App Submission request form filled out and submitted via the provided link.
```
*Accompanying Explanation:* This conceptual checklist helps the AI track its progress in meeting the requirements for app approval. The final step is the actual submission via the external form.

## 4. Key API Endpoints / Functions Used

*   **WHOOP Developer Dashboard (Web UI):** `https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/` (for verifying app info).
*   **App Submission Form (External Link):** `https://whoopinc.typeform.com/to/XmzituEp` (for submitting the approval request).

## 5. Important Notes & Best Practices for AI Implementation

*   **Early Review of Guidelines:** Advise the AI to review the Terms of Use and Design Guidelines early in the development process to avoid rework.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Emphasize the importance of comprehensive testing with real WHOOP data and users within the 10-member limit.
*   **Complete Information:** Stress that providing accurate and complete information in the Developer Dashboard and the submission form is critical for a smooth approval process.
*   **Patience:** Note that responses to the submission form may take some time.
