# Guide: API Pagination with WHOOP

**Purpose:** This document guides a Coding AI Agent on how to paginate through large collections of data returned by the WHOOP API. It explains the use of `nextToken` and `limit` parameters to retrieve full datasets.

## 1. Core Concepts & Prerequisites

Many WHOOP API endpoints that return collections of records (e.g., Cycles, Recovery, Sleep, Workout) may truncate responses to a default number of records. To retrieve all records, you must paginate through the results.

*   **Prerequisite:** Ensure `oauth2_authentication_guide.md` is completed. You must have a valid `access token` for the user.
*   **`nextToken`:** A token returned in the API response that represents the current page. This token is sent in the subsequent request to retrieve the next page of records.
*   **`limit`:** A query parameter that allows you to control the number of records returned per page (up to a maximum allowed value specified per endpoint in the API Docs).

## 2. Implementation Steps

1.  **Initial Request:** Make your first GET request to a collection API endpoint (e.g., `/developer/v1/activity/sleep`).
    *   Optionally, include a `limit` parameter to specify the desired page size.
    *   Include any other relevant query parameters (e.g., `start`, `end`).
    *   Include the `access token` in the `Authorization: Bearer` header.
2.  **Check for `next_token`:** In the response, examine the `next_token` field.
    *   If `next_token` is present and not empty, there are more pages of data.
    *   If `next_token` is empty, you have iterated through all pages.
3.  **Subsequent Requests:** If a `next_token` is present, make a subsequent GET request to the *same* API endpoint.
    *   Include the `nextToken` query parameter with the value received from the previous response.
    *   **Crucially, include the *same* `start` and `end` (or other filtering) query parameters as your initial request.** The `nextToken` is context-dependent.
    *   Continue this process until the `next_token` in the response is empty.

## 3. Code Example(s)

**Example: Paginate through Sleep Data (JavaScript Fetch API)**
```javascript
// Ensure process.env.WHOOP_API_HOSTNAME is set (e.g., 'https://api.prod.whoop.com')

async function getAllSleepDataPaginated(accessToken, startDate, endDate, initialLimit = 50) {
    let allSleepRecords = [];
    let nextToken = null;
    let hasMorePages = true;

    while (hasMorePages) {
        const queryParams = new URLSearchParams({
            start: startDate.toISOString(),
            end: endDate.toISOString(),
            limit: initialLimit.toString(), // Set your desired page limit
        });

        if (nextToken) {
            queryParams.append('nextToken', nextToken);
        }

        const uri = `${process.env.WHOOP_API_HOSTNAME}/developer/v1/activity/sleep?${queryParams.toString()}`;

        try {
            const response = await fetch(uri, {
                headers: {
                    Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
                },
            });

            if (response.status === 200) {
                const data = await response.json();
                if (data.records && data.records.length > 0) {
                    allSleepRecords = allSleepRecords.concat(data.records);
                    console.log(`Fetched ${data.records.length} records. Total so far: ${allSleepRecords.length}`);
                }

                nextToken = data.next_token;
                hasMorePages = !!nextToken; // If nextToken is null/empty, hasMorePages becomes false
            } else if (response.status === 401) {
                console.error("Unauthorized: Access token might be expired or invalid. Trigger refresh.");
                throw new Error("Unauthorized"); // Stop pagination on auth error
            } else {
                const errorData = await response.json();
                throw new Error(`Received ${response.status} status from Whoop: ${JSON.stringify(errorData)}`);
            }
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Error during pagination:", error);
            throw error; // Stop pagination on any error
        }
    }
    console.log(`Finished fetching all sleep data. Total records: ${allSleepRecords.length}`);
    return allSleepRecords;
}

// Example usage: Fetch all sleep data for Q1 2022
// const USER_ACCESS_TOKEN = "YOUR_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN";
// const startQ1 = new Date('2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z');
// const endQ1 = new Date('2022-04-01T00:00:00.000Z');

// getAllSleepDataPaginated(USER_ACCESS_TOKEN, startQ1, endQ1, 20) // Request 20 records per page
//     .then(allRecords => {
//         console.log(`Successfully retrieved a total of ${allRecords.length} sleep records.`);
//         // Process allRecords array
//     })
//     .catch(err => {
//         console.error("Failed to retrieve all sleep data:", err);
//     });
```
*Accompanying Explanation:* This JavaScript function `getAllSleepDataPaginated` demonstrates a common pattern for fetching all pages of a collection. It uses a `while` loop that continues as long as a `next_token` is returned. In each iteration, it appends the `nextToken` to the query parameters for the subsequent request. It's crucial to re-include the original `start` and `end` (or other filtering) parameters with each paginated request.

## 4. Key API Endpoints / Functions Used

*   `GET https://api.prod.whoop.com/developer/v1/activity/sleep`: Example endpoint for sleep collection. (This pattern applies to `cycle`, `recovery`, `workout` collections as well).
    *   Query Parameters:
        *   `nextToken`: The token for the next page.
        *   `limit`: The desired number of records per page.
        *   `start`, `end`: (Optional) Date range filters, which must be consistent across all paginated requests for a given query.

## 5. Important Notes & Best Practices for AI Implementation

*   **Consistency of Filters:** Emphasize that any initial filtering parameters (like `start` and `end` dates) must be included in *every* subsequent paginated request using `nextToken`. The `nextToken` is specific to the original query.
*   **`next_token` as Indicator:** The absence or emptiness of `next_token` is the definitive signal that there are no more pages to fetch.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Be mindful of API rate limits when implementing pagination, especially for large datasets. Consider adding delays between requests if hitting limits. Refer to `api_rate_limiting_guide.md`.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling, especially for `401 Unauthorized` responses, which indicate an expired access token and necessitate a token refresh, potentially stopping the pagination process.
*   **Max Limit:** Be aware that each API endpoint has a maximum allowed `limit` value. Requesting more than this maximum will result in the API returning only up to its maximum.
