description: "Quick overview on how to start using Whoop API"
---
**Purpose:** This document guides a Coding AI Agent on how to set up a developer account, create and manage applications, and understand client credentials within the WHOOP Developer Platform. It covers team creation, app registration, scope definition, redirect URIs, and managing app credentials.

## 1. Core Concepts & Prerequisites

To interact with the WHOOP API, you must first register your application and obtain credentials. The WHOOP Developer Dashboard is the central place for this.

*   **WHOOP Account:** You must have an active WHOOP membership and account. Your WHOOP account credentials are used to log into the Developer Dashboard.
*   **Developer Dashboard:** This web interface (https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/) is used to manage your apps, client secrets, and team members.
*   **Client ID:** A unique identifier for your application.
*   **Client Secret:** A secret value associated with your Client ID, used for authentication. **Never expose this on the client-side.**
*   **Scopes:** Permissions your app requests to access specific types of user data (e.g., `read:profile`, `offline`).
*   **Redirect URIs:** URLs where WHOOP will redirect the user after they authorize your application during the OAuth flow. These must be registered in the Developer Dashboard.

## 2. Implementation Steps

### 2.1. Sign Up for WHOOP

1.  Ensure you have a WHOOP membership. If not, sign up at [join.whoop.com](https://join.whoop.com/?utm_source=whoop&utm_medium=developer).

### 2.2. Create Your Team (if prompted)

1.  Navigate to the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/).
2.  If you haven't created a team before, you will be prompted to "Get Started" with team creation.
3.  Choose a name for your team and click "Create Team".

### 2.3. Create Your First App

1.  Go to the [App creation flow](https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/apps/create) in the Developer Dashboard.
2.  **Define Scopes:** Select the data access permissions your app requires. At least one scope must be specified. Limit scopes to only what your application will use. Refer to the [API Docs](https://developer.whoop.com/api#section/Authentication) for available scopes.
3.  **Specify Redirect URIs:** Enter at least one valid HTTPS or custom scheme URL (e.g., `https://your-app.com/callback` or `your-app://callback`). The URI used in your OAuth authorization request must exactly match one of the registered URIs.
4.  **Complete Client Creation:** Fill in all required fields (App Name, Contact Email(s), Privacy Policy URL) and click the "Create" button.

### 2.4. Access Client Credentials

1.  After creating your App, your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` will be displayed. **Immediately save your `Client Secret` in a secure location**, as it will only be shown once.
2.  You can view your `Client ID` and manage your app details later by navigating to the [Apps section](https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/) in the Developer Dashboard and clicking on your app.

### 2.5. Edit or Delete an App

1.  Navigate to the [Apps section](https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/) in the Developer Dashboard.
2.  Click the pencil icon next to the app you wish to edit. Make your changes and click "Save".
3.  To delete an app, click the red trash can button. **Caution: This action cannot be undone.**

### 2.6. Add Users to a Team

1.  Go to the [Team section](https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/team) of the Developer Dashboard.
2.  Click the "Invite" button in the top right corner.
3.  Enter the email address associated with the WHOOP account of the developer you wish to invite.
4.  Click "Invite".

## 3. Code Example(s)

This section does not contain direct code examples for app creation as it's a manual process within the Developer Dashboard. However, the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` obtained here are crucial for all subsequent API interactions.

**Example: Environment Variable Setup (Conceptual for AI)**
```bash
# Example of how a Coding AI Agent might store credentials securely
# These values are obtained from the WHOOP Developer Dashboard
export WHOOP_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_WHOOP_CLIENT_ID"
export WHOOP_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_WHOOP_CLIENT_SECRET"
export WHOOP_REDIRECT_URI="https://your-app.com/callback"
export WHOOP_API_HOSTNAME="https://api.prod.whoop.com"
```
*Accompanying Explanation:* The `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, and `Redirect URI` are fundamental for your application to authenticate with WHOOP. A Coding AI Agent should store these securely, typically as environment variables, and never hardcode them directly into client-side code. The `WHOOP_API_HOSTNAME` is the base URL for API interactions.

## 4. Key API Endpoints / Functions Used

*   **WHOOP Developer Dashboard (Web UI):**
    *   `https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/apps/create`: For creating new applications.
    *   `https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/`: For managing existing applications and viewing credentials.
    *   `https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/team`: For managing team members.

## 5. Important Notes & Best Practices for AI Implementation

*   **Security of Client Secret:** Emphasize that the `Client Secret` is highly sensitive and must *never* be exposed in client-side code (web or mobile applications). It should only be used server-side.
*   **Scope Minimization:** Advise the AI to request only the minimum necessary scopes for the application's functionality to respect user privacy.
*   **Redirect URI Matching:** Stress the importance of the redirect URI in the OAuth request precisely matching a registered URI in the dashboard to prevent authentication failures.
*   **App Limits:** Note the default limit of 5 apps and the process to request more.
