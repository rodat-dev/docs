title: 'Retrieving recovery data with WHOOP'
description: 'How to get user recovery data'
---
**Purpose:** This document guides a Coding AI Agent on how to retrieve a user's daily recovery scores and related physiological measurements from the WHOOP API. It explains the concept of Recovery and provides the data model and an example for fetching recovery data for a specific cycle.

## 1. Core Concepts & Prerequisites

WHOOP Recovery is a daily metric (0-100%) indicating how prepared the body is to perform, calculated based on factors like resting heart rate (RHR), heart rate variability (HRV), sleep, and more. Recovery scores are tied to a specific physiological `Cycle`.

*   **Prerequisite:** Ensure `oauth2_authentication_guide.md` is completed for token acquisition and `retrieving_cycle_data_guide.md` is understood for obtaining a `cycle_id`. You must have a valid `access token` for the user.
*   **Required Scope:** `read:recovery` and `read:cycles` are necessary to access recovery data.
*   **Recovery Data Model:** Understanding the structure of the `Recovery` object is crucial.

## 2. Implementation Steps

1.  **Obtain Access Token:** Ensure you have a valid `access token` for the WHOOP user.
2.  **Get Cycle ID:** First, retrieve the `cycle_id` for which you want to fetch recovery data. Typically, this will be the latest or current cycle (refer to `retrieving_cycle_data_guide.md`).
3.  **Construct API Request:** Make a GET request to the Recovery API endpoint for a specific cycle: `/developer/v1/cycle/{cycleId}/recovery`.
    *   Include the `access token` in the `Authorization: Bearer` header.
4.  **Process Response:** Parse the JSON response.
    *   Check the `score_state` field:
        *   `SCORED`: The `score` object will be present and contains the recovery percentage and other metrics.
        *   `PENDING_SCORE`: WHOOP is still evaluating; you may need to check again later.
        *   `UNSCORABLE`: Recovery could not be calculated for this cycle.
    *   Check `user_calibrating` within the `score` object (if `SCORED`): New users may be in a calibration period where scores are less relevant.
    *   Handle `404 Not Found` if no recovery data exists for the given cycle (e.g., user didn't wear WHOOP).

## 3. Code Example(s)

This example combines fetching the latest cycle and then its recovery score, as demonstrated in the original documentation's "Get Current Recovery Score" tutorial.

**Example: Getting Current Recovery Score (JavaScript Fetch API)**
```javascript
// Ensure process.env.WHOOP_API_HOSTNAME is set (e.g., 'https://api.prod.whoop.com')

async function getCurrentCycle(accessToken) {
    const query = new URLSearchParams({ limit: "1" });
    const uri = `${process.env.WHOOP_API_HOSTNAME}/developer/v1/cycle?${query.toString()}`;
    const cycleResponse = await fetch(uri, { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}` } });
    if (cycleResponse.status === 200) {
        const data = await cycleResponse.json();
        return data.records && data.records.length > 0 ? data.records[0] : null;
    } else {
        throw new Error(`Received ${cycleResponse.status} status from Whoop for cycle: ${await cycleResponse.text()}`);
    }
}

async function getRecoveryForCycle(accessToken, cycleId) {
    const uri = `${process.env.WHOOP_API_HOSTNAME}/developer/v1/cycle/${cycleId}/recovery`;
    try {
        const recoveryResponse = await fetch(uri, {
            headers: {
                Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
            },
        });

        if (recoveryResponse.status === 200) {
            const recoveryData = await recoveryResponse.json();
            console.log("Successfully retrieved recovery data:", recoveryData);
            return recoveryData;
        } else if (recoveryResponse.status === 404) {
            console.log(`No recovery data found for cycle ID: ${cycleId}`);
            return null; // No recovery for this cycle
        } else if (recoveryResponse.status === 401) {
            console.error("Unauthorized: Access token might be expired or invalid. Trigger refresh.");
            throw new Error("Unauthorized");
        } else {
            const errorData = await recoveryResponse.json();
            throw new Error(`Received ${recoveryResponse.status} status from Whoop for recovery: ${JSON.stringify(errorData)}`);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching recovery for cycle:", error);
        throw error;
    }
}

async function getLatestRecoveryScore(accessToken) {
    try {
        const latestCycle = await getCurrentCycle(accessToken);
        if (!latestCycle) {
            console.log("No latest cycle found to fetch recovery for.");
            return null;
        }

        const recovery = await getRecoveryForCycle(accessToken, latestCycle.id);
        if (recovery) {
            if (recovery.score_state === 'SCORED') {
                if (recovery.score.user_calibrating) {
                    console.log("User is still calibrating, recovery score may not be fully relevant yet.");
                }
                console.log(`Latest Recovery Score: ${recovery.score.recovery_score}%`);
                return recovery.score.recovery_score;
            } else if (recovery.score_state === 'PENDING_SCORE') {
                console.log("Recovery score is pending, check back later.");
            } else if (recovery.score_state === 'UNSCORABLE') {
                console.log("Recovery score is unscorable for this cycle.");
            }
        }
        return null;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to get latest recovery score:", error);
        throw error;
    }
}

// Example usage:
// const USER_ACCESS_TOKEN = "YOUR_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN";
// getLatestRecoveryScore(USER_ACCESS_TOKEN)
//     .then(score => {
//         if (score !== null) {
//             console.log(`Retrieved recovery score: ${score}`);
//         }
//     })
//     .catch(err => {
//         console.error("Error in main recovery fetch flow:", err);
//     });
```
*Accompanying Explanation:* This comprehensive example first calls `getCurrentCycle` (from `retrieving_cycle_data_guide.md`) to get the `cycle_id` of the latest physiological cycle. It then uses this `cycle_id` to call `getRecoveryForCycle`. The `getRecoveryForCycle` function handles `200 OK` (success), `404 Not Found` (no recovery for cycle), and `401 Unauthorized` responses. The `getLatestRecoveryScore` orchestrates these calls and includes logic to check `score_state` and `user_calibrating` before reporting the recovery score.

## 3.1. Recovery Data Model

```json
{
  "cycle_id": 93845,
  "sleep_id": 10235,
  "user_id": 10129,
  "created_at": "2022-04-24T11:25:44.774Z",
  "updated_at": "2022-04-24T14:25:44.774Z",
  "score_state": "SCORED",
  "score": {
    "user_calibrating": false,
    "recovery_score": 44,
    "resting_heart_rate": 64,
    "hrv_rmssd_milli": 31.813562,
    "spo2_percentage": 95.6875,
    "skin_temp_celsius": 33.7
  }
}
```
*Accompanying Explanation:*
*   `cycle_id`, `sleep_id`, `user_id`: Identifiers linking to related data.
*   `score_state`: Indicates if the recovery was `SCORED`, `PENDING_SCORE`, or `UNSCORABLE`. The `score` object is only present if `SCORED`.
*   `score`: Contains detailed recovery metrics:
    *   `user_calibrating`: `true` if the user is new and still in the calibration period.
    *   `recovery_score`: The main recovery percentage (0-100%).
    *   `resting_heart_rate`, `hrv_rmssd_milli`, `spo2_percentage`, `skin_temp_celsius`: Objective physiological measurements.

## 4. Key API Endpoints / Functions Used

*   `GET https://api.prod.whoop.com/developer/v1/cycle/{cycleId}/recovery`: Used to retrieve recovery data for a specific physiological cycle.
*   `GET https://api.prod.whoop.com/developer/v1/cycle`: (Used as a prerequisite) To get the `cycle_id`.

## 5. Important Notes & Best Practices for AI Implementation

*   **Dependency on Cycle ID:** Recovery data is always associated with a `cycle_id`. The AI must first obtain the relevant `cycle_id` before attempting to fetch recovery.
*   **`score_state` Handling:** Always check `score_state`. If `PENDING_SCORE`, the AI should implement a retry mechanism or inform the user to check back later. If `UNSCORABLE`, no recovery score is available.
*   **`user_calibrating`:** Be aware that for new users, `user_calibrating` might be `true`, indicating that the recovery score is still being calibrated and might not be fully representative.
*   **`404 Not Found`:** This is a valid response if no recovery data exists for a given cycle (e.g., user didn't wear their WHOOP). The AI should handle this gracefully.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling, especially for `401 Unauthorized` responses, which indicate an expired access token and necessitate a token refresh.
